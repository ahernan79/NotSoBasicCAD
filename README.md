# Basic CAD
All my basic CAD assignments from the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year.

## Sweeps and Lofts
For these tutorials you had to make a hammer head and a candle holder in Solidworks.

### Hammer Head
Assignment: Follow the given tutorial and use the lofts feature to create a hammer head in solidworks.

What I learned: How to use the lofts feature to bend things between planes.

Challenges: It was fairly challenging to get the planes and everything lined up so I'm not sure I could recreate it.

Challenges: I struggled getting the circles and splines the right angle so it took some trial and error.
